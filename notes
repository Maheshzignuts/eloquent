Simple scenario work here,
1>has belongs to used for get value of parent model.
2>it is the inverse of the has and hasmany model.
3>latestofMany get latest record from eloquent.
4>oldestOfMany get first record from many records
5>ofMany has also used for aggregate function in eloqunt.

***
hasOne->this is the call only on ids,
hasMany->this is the call only on ids,
belongsTo
hasOneThrough ->this has used for get data from third table.
hasManyThrough->this is the same for the get data from the third table.

BelongstoMany->required third table to access the data in model.
-Like , user, role is has required user_role model for accessing data

***
Polymorphic one to one 

in polymorphic relation ship , child model can access with multiple model.

OneToMany
in polymorphic relationsship, child model can access with multiple model, we can use this inmodel morphMany method for both table.
